        <h1>BIO</h1>
    
        <p>Gerald Earl Gillium aka "G-eazy" is an American rapper. With having the influence of arts and musical talent around him his whole life, 
        it was only a matter of time before he started his own journey into the industry. Having very close friends such as Marty Grimes already 
        being a part of the rap scene, this only encouraged him more to start making music. When he began engineering music samples it was very easy
        and available for him due to his parents, one being a musician, aiding him and providing some help with his music. After a few years of trying 
        to improve and gain experience he managed to release a few successful albums such as "The Endless Summer" from 2011, "Must Be Nice" from the 
        following year. The album that changed his whole career was titled "These Things Happen", it being his first album to hit the masses. 
        Since then he has been making a good collection of music with the more popular albums being produced the next couple of years. Since then 
        he has opened up his own clothing line along with other miscellaneous products for the fans to get their hands on.
